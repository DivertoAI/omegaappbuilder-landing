# Revenue Upside Addendum (12-Month Target)

## Studio-First Revenue Engine
Omega operates a studio model to generate revenue immediately while the platform scales.

**Typical studio deal profile**
- Implementation fees: $50K–$250K per project
- Retainers: $5K–$25K per month
- Typical cycle: 4–10 weeks per project

**12‑month studio revenue scenario**
- 12–24 projects at $75K–$150K each = **$0.9M–$3.6M**
- Retainers across 10–20 clients = **$0.6M–$3.0M**

## Platform Revenue Upside
As the builder gains traction, subscriptions + usage credits scale in parallel.

**Subscription + usage scenario**
- 500–2,000 paid users at $99–$199 ARPU = **$0.6M–$4.8M ARR**
- Usage credits add 10–25% on top

## Combined Potential (Aggressive Marketing + Enterprise Deals)
**$1–10M+ ARR within 12 months** is achievable by combining studio revenue and platform subscriptions, especially with AI receptionist deployments as a repeatable vertical.
