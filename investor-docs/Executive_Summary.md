# Executive Summary

**Company:** Omega (Studio + AI Builder)  
**Stage:** Seed  
**Raise:** $2.5M (target, adjustable)  
**Use of Funds:** Product + infra + GTM  

## One-Liner
Omega is a studio-first AI product company delivering high-ticket custom AI solutions (including AI receptionists) while building **Omega AI Builder** — a Replit-level platform that turns prompts into production-ready, multi-platform codebases with live preview and export.

## The Big Idea
Omega is engineered for **two engines of growth**:
1) **Studio Revenue Now** — high-margin implementation fees + retainers.  
2) **Platform Scale Later** — recurring subscriptions + usage credits.

This hybrid model funds rapid product velocity and creates a compounding flywheel: studio projects generate domain data, workflows, and case studies that make the platform smarter and more marketable.

## Why We Win
- **AI-first workflow** (not an IDE with AI bolted on).
- **Full build–edit–deploy loop** in a single workspace.
- **Vertical repeatability** (AI receptionists + business automation).
- **Economic alignment**: usage-based revenue scales with infra spend.

## Market
Developer tools + AI automation is a massive, fast-growing market. The shift to AI-led build workflows unlocks a new category of “prompt-to-production” platforms.

## Business Model
- Studio implementation fees + retainers
- Platform subscription tiers + usage credits
- Enterprise plans (security, SSO, SLAs)

## Revenue Upside (12 months)
With focused marketing and enterprise deals, Omega can reach **$1–10M+ ARR** by combining studio revenue and platform subscriptions. This is a high-upside, execution-driven outcome.

## Ask
$2.5M seed to scale studio growth, harden infra, and reach Replit-level MVP.
